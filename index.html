          <main class="biography">
      <p><strong>Grace Brewster Murray Hopper</strong> (née <strong>Murray</strong>; December 9, 1906 – January 1, 1992) was an American
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_scientist" target="_blank"> computer scientist</a>
        and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Navy" target="_blank">United States Navy</a>
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rear_admiral_(United_States)" target="_blank">rear admiral</a>. <mark>One of the
        first programmers of the Harvard Mark I computer</mark>, she was a pioneer of computer programming who invented one of the
        first compiler related tools. She popularized the idea of machine-independent programming languages, which led to the
        development of COBOL, an early high-level programming language still in use today.</p>
      <p>Hopper had attempted to enlist in the Navy during <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II" target="_blank">World War II</a>,
        but she was rejected by the military because she was 34 years of age and too old to enlist. She instead joined the Navy Reserves. Hopper
        began her computing career when she worked on the Harvard Mark I team that was led by Howard H. Aiken. In 1949, she joined the
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eckert%E2%80%93Mauchly_Computer_Corporation" target="_blank">Eckert–Mauchly Computer Corporation</a>
        and was part of the development team that designed the UNIVAC I computer in 1944. It was at Eckert–Mauchly
        that she began developing the compiler. She believed that computer code could be written in English by using a programming
        language that was based on English words. The compiler would convert that code into machine code that would be understood
        by computers. By 1952, Hopper finished her compiler, which was written for the A-0 System programming language</p>
      <p>In 1954, Eckert–Mauchly chose Hopper to lead their department for automatic programming, and she led the release of some of
        the first compiled languages like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FLOW-MATIC" target="_blank">FLOW-MATIC</a>. In 1959, she participated
        in the CODASYL consortium, which consulted Hopper to guide them in creating a machine-independent programming language. This led to the COBOL language, which was inspired by her
        idea of a language being based on English words. In 1966, she retired from the Naval Reserve, but in 1967, the Navy recalled
        her to active duty. She retired from the Navy in 1986 and found work as a consultant for the Digital Equipment Corporation,
        sharing her computing experiences.</p>
      <p>Owing to her accomplishments and her naval rank, she was sometimes referred to as "Amazing Grace".The U.S. Navy
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arleigh_Burke-class_destroyer" target="_blank">Arleigh Burke-class</a> guided-missile
        destroyer USS Hopper was named for her, as was the Cray XE6 "Hopper" supercomputer at NERSC During
        her lifetime, Hopper was awarded 40 honorary degrees from universities across the world. In 1991, she received the National Medal
